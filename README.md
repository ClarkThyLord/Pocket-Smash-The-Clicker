# About Repository

This repository was created on a late April afternoon, 2017, with the purpose of creating
a video game, just for fun, with some friends from school using the Construct 2 game engine.
However, things fell through, because of one thing or another; never the less, we
decided to abandon the game all together.

Few months later is when GitHub announced their game jam for 2017. As soon as I heard of it
I wanted to join, but lacked the drive to do so. However a couple of days into the
competition I was reminded of it by my friend during school.

Since, at the time, we weren't doing anything too important in class I started thinking
of possible games I can develop for the game jam, with the "throwback" theme on my mind.
Soon enough, I started thinking about pokemon and how much
I enjoyed the fights and collection of pokemon; but, at the same time I
detested the constant grinding and repetition that was needed to be able to enjoy those things. Which lead me to this game game where I can have everything I love without the stuff I hate.

So, to make a long story short, I had this rep sitting around without use, and wanted the name 
“Pocket-Smash” for my game jam submission. Which is why I recycled the rep for my game jam 
project. Meaning nothing in this rep was worked on previous to the game jam.
