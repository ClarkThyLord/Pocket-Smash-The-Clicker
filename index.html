    <span>
      The GitHub repository is old while the game itself is new, meaning non of the code was made before the game jam. I did this because I liked the name, Pocket Smash, and I was too lazy to delete and redo the rep. XD

	  I think you'll do more grinding in the first five minutes of this game; then you'll ever do in all the pokem games combined. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    <div style="font-size: 27px;">P.S.</div>

    <span>
      You'll die... a lot XP
